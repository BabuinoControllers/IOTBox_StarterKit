# IOT Brick Starter Kit

### The IOT solution that is ready when you are

---

This is the starter kit of IOTBrick - BR001 the IOT solution that provides a general purpose device ready to be used for a wide range of applications. IOT Bricks comes already with an hardware, a firmware and connectivity but does not implement any application logic. Application logic shall be configured according to the application needs just by connecting together several functional blocks. Functional blocks are basic blocks that transform inputs into outputs following specific configurable function. Connecting togheter the input and the output of functional blocks it is ipossible to implement a wide range of application logic.

## Why IOT Brick?
Most IOT projects fails for many reasons: 
- Businness objective not well designed
- Technological complexity and missing know how
- Development costs including hardware and software
- Industrialization costs

On the other side most of IOT projects share common requirements. IOT Brick technology try to share development, implementation and industrialization efforts of one projects with others by providing a general purpose device covering a wide range of applciations that can be simply integrated in complex IOT architecture.

## About IOT Brick
IOT Brick - BR001 is a secure unit designed as general-purpose IOT device by [Babuino Controllers](https://babuinocontrollers.com) 

with the aim to eeduce or avoid development effort of hardware and firmware.
Easy integration in application context.
Reduce time to market of IOT devices.

simplify the design, the implementation and the delivery of an IOT product in the market. With IOT Brick there is no need to
develop hardware and firmware. The device comes already in a package with electronics and firmware
and is ready for the deployment. It includes, among the others, a set of connectivity tools and an open
logic based on functional blocks. Without any hardware development and firmware programming it is
possible to implement a large variety of applications and use cases just configuring the functional blocks
provided by the device. So, development moves from hardware and firmware development to logic
configuration. IOT Brick is a connected object that can be controlled remotely by any device or
application including app on smartphone or other smart devices. Each unit comes with six configurable
inputs and four outputs. Input can be configured to be analog and digital. Number of inputs and outputs
can be extended by connecting additional units via RS485 and Ethernet. To simplify the integration in
operating environment and applications an SDK (Software development kit) for desktop, server and
mobile (Android and IOS) is available.
